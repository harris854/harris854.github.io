               I am an enthusiastic and resolute software engineer with +5 years of experience. I am able to work on own initiative as well be part of a team. I am always ready to take challenges and can quickly grasp new concepts and ideas. Besides coding, I have a good experience in project management.
               <!-- I started my professional career from Leapfrog Technologies Inc., a software company headquartered in Seattle, WA. Working in the Java architecture team as a Software Engineer, I got a chance to envision, design and develop scalable software solutions in an agile environment. At Leapfrog, I worked on SAAS application named Small Business Workbench (a cash forecasting app) where I implemented Content Delivery Network throughout the application using Amazon S3 cloud storage and successfully integrated cash forecasting app with Intuit QuickBooks. I also worked on Anti Money Laundering System (AML) which enables the subscribers (banks) to search entities against global/localized sanctions list and social media.</br> -->
               <!-- In Spring 2017, I started pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at the University Of North Dakota, with a focus on Algorithm, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. Building on the foundation laid at work, I took courses like Advance Artificial Intelligence, High-Performance Computing and Software Architecture that aligned with my passion for building quality software systems. </br> -->
               <!-- I am interested in algorithm optimization and machine learning. I am a highly motivated, quick learner, able to work independently or on a team and drive solutions. Currently, I am actively seeking challenging fulltime opportunity in software development and research. -->

                    It is a Workflow management system including document management and Reporting. It was developed in ASP.NET MVC 3 and MSSQL database. I had fix bugs reported by the client. Further, I have added features like privacy setting for the group, as previously the privacy setting should be given to an individual person. During that, I had to make changes from the database procedure level. I sometimes had to visit client (Standard Chartered Bank, Kathmandu) for implementing a bug fix.

                    It is a CRM system having role-based access and operations. This also has performance reporting, follow up management as well as cross inquiry feature. It also was a small workflow management system customized for travel and ticketing company. I was assigned to develop that system completely. During I had to take the requirement from the client, design and develop the system and finally test that singly. I had developed the system using twitter-bootstrap, ASP.NET MVC 4 and MSSQL database. After doing the research I implemented customized impersonate in the system. I also had done works in creating a stored procedure for the reporting part.

                   It is an attendance management system along with various HR functions and reporting. Bio-metric devices and Web portal is used to take attendance. This was software designed to communicate with different biometric fingerprint attendance devices in the network and prepare the report. In addition, it has a leave management system. It was developed in ASP.NET MVC 3 and MSSQL database. There was a serious problem in the software in synchronization which I fixed changing the data pulling mechanism. I also had completed incomplete modules of leave management and reporting. For problem fixing, I had to visit the client (Standard Chartered Bank, Kathmandu) often.
